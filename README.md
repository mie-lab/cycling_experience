## 📖 Project Overview
This project analyzes how environmental factors impact a cyclist's emotional experience (affective response). The workflow uses results from a large online survey to inform a controlled lab study, with a key focus on comparing manually created vs. LLM-generated video descriptions for downstream analyses purposes.

The core pipeline is as follows:

* **Predictive Modeling & Candidate Selection**: Analyzes cyclist ratings from a large survey to train a model that selects affectively diverse videos for the lab study.
* **Video Content Description**: Uses two parallel methods—manual "ground truth" labeling and automated LLM-based feature extraction—to describe video events and environmental features.
* **Physiological Data Processing**: Extracts heart rate (PPG) and skin conductance (EDA) metrics, calculating baseline-corrected "Deltas" to measure physiological reactivity.
* **Lab Study & SEM Analysis**: Performs general analysis of lab ratings and employs Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze how subjective and physiological responses are influenced by static (e.g., scenery) and dynamic (e.g., traffic) elements.
* **Presence & Immersion**: Analyzes the Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) to evaluate participant immersion during the lab study across different demographics.

## 🚀 Running the Analysis Pipeline

1.  **Generate the Ground Truth**:
    ```bash
    python build_ground_truth.py
    ```
    * **Description**: Aggregates geospatial data (traffic, greenery, bike networks) and runs semantic segmentation on video frames.
    * **Output**: 30 frames per video, `segmentation_results.csv`, and the master `video_ground_truth.csv`.

2.  **Run the Online Survey Analysis**:
    ```bash
    python online_survey_analysis.py
    ```
    * **Description**: Processes online ratings to assess valence/arousal, and generates demographic summaries to establish 'bikeable' or 'non-bikeable labels'.
    * **Output**: Processed survey data and affect-grid visualizations in `output_data/`.

3.  **Predict Candidate Videos**:
    ```bash
    python candidate_video_prediction.py
    ```
    * **Description**: Uses KNN clustering and RMSE optimization to predict valence for candidate videos based on geospatial and semantic features.
